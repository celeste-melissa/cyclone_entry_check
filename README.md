# ðŸŽ¢ Cyclone Entry Check

This is a simple Python program that simulates an entry check system for the amusement park ride **"The Cyclone"**. It verifies if a user is eligible to ride based on their height and available credits.

## âœ… Requirements to Ride "The Cyclone"
- Height must be **at least 137 cm**
- User must have **at least 10 credits**

---

## ðŸ’» How It Works

1. The program prompts the user to enter their height in **feet**.
2. It converts the height from feet to **centimeters**.
3. The user is then asked to input how many **credits** they have.
4. Based on the height and credits, the system prints a message indicating:
   - If the user can ride.
   - If they're too short.
   - If they don't have enough credits.
   - Or if both requirements aren't met.

## ðŸ§ª Sample Run

```bash
What is your height in feet? 4.7
Height: 143.26 cm
How many credits do you have? 9
Credits: 9
You don't have enough credits to ride.
